âœ¨ StyleGen: Fashion Generator 
Project Description
StyleGen is a web application that leverages a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) to generate unique fashion outfits based on simple mask shapes provided by the user. It serves as a demonstration of how deep learning models can be used in creative applications like fashion design synthesis.

The application allows users to either upload their own mask image (a white shape on a black background) or select from a few pre-defined mask images. The trained CGAN model then processes the chosen mask and generates a corresponding full fashion outfit image.

How it Works
The core of StyleGen is a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) implemented using PyTorch.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are composed of two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The Generator attempts to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the Discriminator learns to differentiate between real and generated data. Through adversarial training, both networks improve.

Conditional GANs (CGANs) introduce conditional information (in this case, the mask image) to both the Generator and Discriminator. This conditioning guides the generation process, allowing the Generator to create outputs that are relevant to the input mask.

In StyleGen, the Generator takes the input mask image and a random noise vector. The mask provides the structural constraint (the shape of the garment), and the noise vector introduces variability, allowing the model to generate different styles of outfits for the same mask shape. The Discriminator helps ensure the generated outfits are realistic and adhere to the mask condition.

How to Use
Access the Application: StyleGen is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and can be accessed at:
https://stylegen.streamlit.app/

Choose Your Mask: On the main page, you will see options to select your mask input:

Upload Custom Mask: Click the "Upload your mask image..." button to upload your own image file (PNG, JPG, or JPEG) containing a white shape on a black background.

Use Default Mask: Select one of the pre-defined mask images from the dropdown menu.

View Generated Outfit: Once you select or upload a mask, the application will automatically process it using the CGAN model. The input mask and the generated fashion outfit will be displayed side-by-side.

Explore Diversity: If you use the same mask multiple times (especially with a custom mask), the random noise vector will change, potentially generating slightly different outfit styles for the same shape.

Running Locally (Optional)
If you wish to run StyleGen on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/AtharvaNagarsekar/StyleGen.git
cd StyleGen

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in your repository listing the necessary libraries like streamlit, torch, torchvision, Pillow, numpy.)

Install Git LFS: If you haven't already, install Git LFS and run git lfs install.

git lfs install

Download the Checkpoint File: Git LFS will handle downloading the large model checkpoint file (fashion_cgan_checkpoint_hfds.pth) when you clone the repository or after running git lfs pull if needed.

Run the Streamlit App:

streamlit run app.py

This will start the application, and it will open in your web browser.
